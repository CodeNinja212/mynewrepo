### Let's quickly talk about Kingdom Hearts.

> "May your heart be your guiding key."

The Kingdom Hearts series is a set of video games, originally released as exclusives on the PlayStation consoles by Squaresoft, now known as Square Enix.
The series contains several games that span across different consoles, from the PlayStation 2 where the first game of the titular franchise was released, all the way to the modern PlayStation 4 and 5 consoles.

Each game's story focuses on certain events, while the primary games - the first Kingdon Hearts game often referred to as Kingdom Hearts 1, Kingdon Hearts 2, and Kingdon Hearts 3, tell the major events of the game's overarching storyline.
The games feature a wide cast, from Disney characters like the beloved cast of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy, to the well-known characters of Final Fantasy like Cloud Strife and Tifa Lockehart, and a set of original characters.
Most games feature a boy named Sora as the playable protagonist, who wields a magical weapon named the Keyblade and is tasked certain yet vague objectives that only make a little more sense with each game.

The series' primary games following the main cast are as follows, in order of events:
- Kingdom Hearts Union X (Cross)
- Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep
- Kingdom Hearts
- Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (with an HD re-release, Kingdom Hearts: Re:Chain of Memories)
- Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days
- Kingdom Hearts 2
- Kingdom Hearts: 0.2 - A Fragmentary Passage (also known as Kingdom Hearts: 2.8, also happens after Birth By Sleep)
- Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance
- Kingdom Hearts 3
- Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory
